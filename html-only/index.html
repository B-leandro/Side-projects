        <h1>Shouldn't you use paper instead?</h1>
        <p>See why it is inconvenient to write on pixels and start now loving paper, guide provided</p>
        <h2>Paper will never Blue Screen</h2>
        <p>For how rare it might seem, blue screen happens, and you can't know when. 
            It could be anytime soon, maybe before you can finish this article, maybe tomorrow, but it <strong>will</strong> happen, <em>soon. </em>
            The best way to prevent this is using a piece of paper, better known as <i>parchment</i> or <i>vellum</i>, as you prefer.</p>
        <h3>How to get some vellum</h3>
        <p>Easy! Take a rifle, shoot a goat, take its skin and you're ready to go! If you have doubts about the procedure don't hesitate asking around, 
           there are many printed books with information (although I'd go for hand-written material, then you know the dude was serious about his writings).
        </p>
        <h4>Did you know?</h4>
        <p>Parchment comes from a mix of latin and french. <i>Pergamon</i> was the city where the procedure for creating parchment became most refined around II century b.C.</p>
        <h2>Writing made fun</h2>
        <p>So you got your goat to write on, but what can you write with?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>pencil</li>
            <li>ink</li>
            <li>dirty finger</li>
        </ul>
        <p>or even better:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>blood</li>
            <li>the goat's blood</li>
            <li>lead-base ink</li>
        </ol>
